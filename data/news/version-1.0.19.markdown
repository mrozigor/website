Title: Kanboard 1.0.19
Date: 2015-10-11

New plugin API
--------------

This release brings a new plugin system.
This is the first draft of the plugin API.

The goal is to make Kanboard more flexible. Any developer should be able add new features, extend or override the default behavior of Kanboard.
At the moment, the plugin API is not complete so it's possible to ask for new hooks in the issues tracker.

The second objective is to simplify the code base.
**Kanboard focus on simplicity**.
Non necessary features should be a plugin, in this version some features have been moved outside of the core.

Core functionalities moved to plugins:

* Budget planning: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-budget
* SubtaskForecast: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-subtask-forecast
* Timetable: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-timetable

People who where using these features need to install the necessary plugins to have the fonctionnality back.

To install a plugin, you just need to unzip the archive in the plugins folder, that's it.
