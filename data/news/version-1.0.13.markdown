Here are the main improvements for this release:

Project budget
--------------

The budget section is available for each project.
The data used for the calculation come from the subtask time tracking, the user timetable and the user hourly rate.

![Budget Graph](https://kanboard.net/screenshots/documentation/budget-graph.png)

When you start a new project you can define a budget line.
Then Kanboard will calculate the cost for you based on the user timesheet.

User hourly rate
----------------

Each user can have a different hourly rate, this feature is used for the budget calculation.

User timetable
--------------

For each person, you can define a regular timetable for the week but also schedule time-off and overtime.

This data is also used in the calendar if you have enabled the subtask time tracking.
The time spent takes into account the worked hours.

Task transitions
----------------

Each time you move a task to another column, Kanboard records this action in a seperate table now.
So you have a better understanding of the history of the task.

Two factor authentication
-------------------------

Kanboard supports the two factor authentication by using the standard [Time-based One-time Password Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm) defined in the [RFC 6238](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238).

After each successful authentication, Kanboard will ask you a pin code generated by any TOTP compatible software.

There are many free and open source software available:

- [Google Authenticator](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/) (Android, iOS, Blackberry)
- [FreeOTP](https://fedorahosted.org/freeotp/) (Android, iOS)
- [OATH Toolkit](http://www.nongnu.org/oath-toolkit/) (Command line utility on Unix/Linux)

This method doesn't use any mobile phone and can be used offline.
