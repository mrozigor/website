Title: Kanboard 1.0.15

Here are the main improvements for this release:

Recurring tasks
---------------

It's now possible to configure recurring tasks in Kanboard.
To fit with the Kanban methodology, the recurring tasks are not based on a date but on board events.

- Recurring tasks are duplicated to the first column of the board when the selected events occurs (Moving a task from the first/last column or closing a task)
- The due date can be recalculated automatically
- Each task records the task id of the parent task that created it and the child task created

Such as Slack and Hipchat integrations, notifications can be sent to a Jabber chat room.

Improved task links
-------------------

- Allow auto-completion with the task id
- Links are grouped by label and more information are displayed (assignee and time tracking)
- It's now possible to edit a task link

Calendar improvements
---------------------

- The calendar is able to show all tasks in addition of tasks with a due date.
- The date of the events can be configured to be the task start date (default) or the creation date.

iCal feeds
----------

- For each project and user, you can subscribe to the iCalendar subscription.
- You can export the same information as the internal calendar to any calendar software like Apple Calendar, Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.
- This is a read-only access, it's not a CalDAV access.
