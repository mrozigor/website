Title: Kanboard 1.0.33
Date: 2016-09-05
---

The user interface is now more responsive for mobiles and tablets. 
Resizing the browser window will not break the user interface like before.

This release is also the beginning of the modernization of the tools used to build the user interface.

The vanilla CSS has been converted to SASS with variables and mixins. 
This is now easier to customize the different styles, colors or fonts.

Some Javascript code has been converted to [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) components. 
The long-term goal is to replace most jQuery stuff with a modern Javascript framework.
