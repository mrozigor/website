A lot of code refactoring has been made to have an extensible and flexible system.
It's now possible to write plugins to propose alternative authentication backends.

Groups and Teams
----------------

With Kanboard, a group of people is like a team.
Each user can be assigned to one or multiple groups.
Then each project manager can authorize projects access to a group while assigning a specific role for the project.

More over, a new project role have been created "Project Viewer", these users only have read-only access to the project.

Enterprises that use Kanboard can also configure the [LDAP groups synchronization](https://kanboard.net/documentation/ldap-group-sync).
