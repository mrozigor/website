Calendars are visible on the dashboard, in the project view and from the user page.

For now, tasks with a due date and subtask time tracking are shown (see below).
Moving the task to another day change the due date.

Improved board filters
----------------------

Now, the filters hide the tasks instead of changing the opacity.
Moreover, the user interface have been improved to be more flexible:

Task stacking (expand/collapse tasks on the board)
---------------------------------------------------

When you have a lot of tasks on the board, it's very useful to collapse tasks:

This feature can be toggled by using the keyboard shortcut **s** or with the board menu.

Dropdown menu for tasks on the board
------------------------------------

A new dropdown menu is available for each task on the board for quick editing:

Task links and relations
------------------------

Now, you can link tasks together:
