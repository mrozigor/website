Some sections have been moved to focus on the most used features.

Improvements on the user interface are never done.
The goal is to have a software that will be more efficient and more robust after each iteration.

## Improved dashboard

Projects and subtasks with sorting and pagination have been added to the dashboard:

- The API return the id of created elements and some procedures have been added

## Code refactoring and more unit tests

- Kanboard use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to manage the dependencies.
- More unit tests have been written to improve the reliability
- A lot of code refactoring have been made to reduce the complexity and improve the maintainability
- Templates are organized into sub-folders now
- The command line tool use the package `Symfony\Console`
- Debug logs are sent to Syslog and `data/debug.log` with `Monolog`
- Of course, many bugs have been fixed

## Change about the minimum requirements

The version 1.0.10 requires at least **PHP 5.3.7**.
That means a default PHP installation on [Debian 6 Squeeze](/documentation/debian-installation) are not supported anymore.

Note: I don't maintain anymore the official Docker image on Docker Hub.
However you can always [build your own image](/documentation/docker) from the repository.

## Focus for the next version

- Add swimlanes
- Gitlab webhooks
- Continue to improve everything else
