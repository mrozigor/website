New open source license for Kanboard
------------------------------------

Kanboard is now distributed under the MIT License instead of the AGPLv3 license.
This license is more permissive and impose less restrictions.

The MIT license is also more "corporate friendly", legal departments of many large companies do not accept software under GPL license for various reasons.
Now, they can try Kanboard without any constraints.

Advanced search syntax
----------------------

The main change of this version is the new search engine that uses a simple query language.

![Search](https://kanboard.net/screenshots/tour/board-filters.png)

The query language is very useful for advanced search.
You can find tasks by assignee, swimlane, column, due date, categories, description, etc.

The same search engine is available globally for all projects and it's also used to filter the board.

New project view switcher
-------------------------

Now, you can switch easily between the board, calendar and list views:

Keyboard shortcuts are available too.

URL rewriting
-------------

Kanboard have nice urls now, it's automatically enabled if you already have the Apache mode rewrite enabled.

Some shortcuts are available:

- Go to the task #123: **/t/123**
- Go to the board of the project #2: **/b/2**
- Go to the project calendar #5: **/c/5**
- Go to the list view of the project #8: **/l/8**

Lead and cycle time
-------------------

- The lead time is the time between the task creation and the date of completion (task closed).
- The cycle time is the time between the start date and the date of completion.

- Each task have new section analytics that display the lead and cycle time
- In project reports, you can see a chart with the average lead and cycle time

Average time into each column
-----------------------------

A new project report is available that display the average time spent into each column:
